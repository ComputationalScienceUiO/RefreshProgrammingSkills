    "  * Armadillo is a C++ linear algebra library (matrix maths) aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. The syntax is deliberately similar to Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Integer, floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are provided through optional integration with LAPACK, or one of its high performance drop-in replacements (such as the multi-threaded MKL or ACML libraries).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A delayed evaluation approach is employed (at compile-time) to combine several operations into one and reduce (or eliminate) the need for temporaries. This is accomplished through recursive templates and template meta-programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Useful for conversion of research code into production environments, or if C++ has been decided as the language of choice, due to speed and/or integration capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The library is open-source software, and is distributed under a license that is useful in both open-source and commercial/proprietary contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are simple examples."
