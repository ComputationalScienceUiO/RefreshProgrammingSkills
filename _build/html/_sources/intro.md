Introduction
============================

The aim behind this Jupyter-Book is to provide you, in an easy and
accessible way, with various programming and software resources that
you may find useful for your studies. We want these pages to be the
result of a collaborative and fluid effort. This means that if you
come across tools, software etc you think are useful and that you
would like to share with the rest of us, please never hesitate to do
so. Your inputs and feedbacks are essential for making this a useful
resource. Sharing your insights with fellow students and collaborators
is a hallmark of a good, and welcoming,  scientific environment.

The resources span from refreshing elements of programming languages
like Python, C++, Julia, Rust and other to version control software
like _Git_, development enviroments like _Overleaf_ for typesetting of
documents in _Latex_, to many other useful features and softwaresthat hopefully will
make your work on your thesis, whether this is an undergraduate
project, your Master of Science thesis or PhD thesis, a smooth and
pleasant experience.
