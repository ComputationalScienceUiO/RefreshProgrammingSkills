# # Setup And Libraries

# Course participants are expected to have their own laptops/PCs. We use _Git_ as version control software and the usage of providers like _GitHub_, _GitLab_ or similar are strongly recommended.
# 
# We will make extensive use of Python as programming language and its
# myriad of available libraries.
# 
# If you have Python installed and you feel
# pretty familiar with installing different packages, we recommend that
# you install the following Python packages via _pip_ as 
# 
# * pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn mglearn sympy pandas pillow 
# 
# For OSX users we recommend, after having installed Xcode, to
# install _brew_. Brew allows for a seamless installation of additional
# software via for example 
# 
# * brew install python3
# 
# For Linux users, with its variety of distributions like for example the widely popular Ubuntu distribution,
# you can use _pip_ as well and simply install Python as 
# 
# * sudo apt-get install python3
# 
# You will find Jupyter notebooks invaluable in your work.  You can run _Python_
# code in the Jupyter notebooks, with the immediate benefit of
# visualizing your data. You can also use compiled languages like C++,
# Rust, Julia, Fortran etc if you prefer. The focus in these lectures will be mainly 
# on Python.
# 
# To install and start running jupyter lab (the newest and best notebook interface), follow the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
# 
# ## Python installers
# 
# If you don't want to perform these operations separately and venture
# into the hassle of exploring how to set up dependencies and paths, we
# recommend two widely used distrubutions which set up all relevant
# dependencies for Python, namely 
# 
# * Anaconda:https://docs.anaconda.com/, 
# 
# which is an open source
# distribution of the Python and R programming languages for large-scale
# data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that
# aims to simplify package management and deployment. Package versions
# are managed by the package management system _conda_. 
# 
# * Enthought canopy:https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/ 
# 
# is a Python
# distribution for scientific and analytic computing distribution and
# analysis environment, available for free and under a commercial
# license.
# 
# Furthermore, Google's Colab:https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires 
# no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. Try it out!
# 
# ## Useful Python libraries
# Here we list several useful Python libraries we strongly recommend (if you use anaconda many of these are already there)
# 
# * _NumPy_:https://www.numpy.org/ is a highly popular library for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
# * _The pandas_:https://pandas.pydata.org/ library provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools 
# * _Xarray_:http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/ is a Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun!
# * _Scipy_:https://www.scipy.org/ (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. 
# * _Matplotlib_:https://matplotlib.org/ is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
# * _Autograd_:https://github.com/HIPS/autograd can automatically differentiate native Python and Numpy code. It can handle a large subset of Python's features, including loops, ifs, recursion and closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives
# * _SymPy_:https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. 
# * _scikit-learn_:https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ has simple and efficient tools for machine learning, data mining and data analysis
# * _TensorFlow_:https://www.tensorflow.org/ is a Python library for fast numerical computing created and released by Google
# * _Keras_:https://keras.io/ is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano
# * And many more such as _pytorch_:https://pytorch.org/,  _Theano_:https://pypi.org/project/Theano/ etc
